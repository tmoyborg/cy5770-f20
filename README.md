Projects from the course Software Vulnerabilities and Security (CY 5770)

The coursework involved numerous projects (challenges) such as:
1. Basic Warm Up
2. General Unix Security
3. SQL Injection
4. Parameter Injection
5. Buffer Overflow
6. Remote Exploit
7. Reverse Engineering
8. Simple Virus

This repo contains folders of exploit payload or code. Folders for every challenge will not be available as some of the challenges just required a couple of lines of terminal commands (post analysis) and hence, dedicating a folder and file(s) for a couple of lines of terminal commands does not provide any value (IMO).

Having said that, I would be happy to discuss more about the projects (if anyone wants to know more or needs any help).
