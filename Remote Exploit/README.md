# Remote Exploit

The objective of this challenge was to exploit a remote server that has a buffer overflow vulnerability and is listening on port 8000. The server runs a multi-threaded connection and can be exploited remotely through a shellcode injection and buffer overflow technique.

We were provided unique shellcode that would open up a socket connection over a specific port number. I used netcat to listen for incoming connections over that port and then used my Python program 'payload.py' to transfer the exploit payload. I automated the process to get the correct return address for the buffer through my Bash script 'attackscript.sh'. The script transferred decimal values in the hexadecimal ranges from 'D200' to 'DCFF'. This return address range was actually '0xFFFFD200' to '0xFFFFDCFF', which was found through locally exploiting the server binary (which was provided to us).
