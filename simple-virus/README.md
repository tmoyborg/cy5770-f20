#Simple-Virus

The objective of this project was to write a simple self-propagating virus for Linux ELF executables. The server would make the 'virus.c' program and execute it locally. The first iteration would infect any ELF executable within that folder and then the binary 'virus' would be removed. Post that, the virus should self-propagate whenever the infected ELF executable is called, to further infect other non-infected executables, while also maintaining the functionality of the ELF executable. After the execution, a simple string "Hello! I am a simple virus!" should be displayed to stdout.

Because the server for submission would only package 'virus.c' file and execute it locally, I developed the infection and self-propagating functionality through a Python program 'virus.py'. I, then, use the C program to store the base64 encoded version of my Python program, deploy and decode it locally first, before executing it. The Python program checks for infected ELF files and checks if the file is writable. It stores the exploit payload (bad contents) in a file and infects any non-infected ELF executable by adding the bad contents to that ELF executable. It then deletes all traces and returns to the C program. The C program handles the execution of the infected ELF executable without any change in functionality and displays the string in stdout.
